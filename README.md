freelance website for client business NH CUSTOM TATOO

## Overview

Client looking to revive business wanted a competitive website with attractive content.  I created the logo, slogn, and written content for the site.  

Using Javascript, PHP, HTML, and CSS I was able to put together a stunning multipage site with responsive design.  Tested responsiveness with variety 
of important VP sizes in dev tools.

Assisting with search Engine optimzation and Pay Per Click marketing.

Working with client to produce a quality blog and update site occasionally.  


### Result

Client is very pleased and site will be deployed along with new marketing campaign designed to give the business a boost of adrenaline during what I can
only ascertain is a large recession or depression.  

NH Custom Tattoo has never been fresher.
